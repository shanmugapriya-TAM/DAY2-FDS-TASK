1.Write the blog on the difference between Document and window objects
Document Objects:
The document object represents the web page.If you want to access any element in an HTML page, you always start with accessing the document object.
When an HTML document is loaded into a web browser, it becomes a document object. 
This object serves as the root node of the HTML document.
What is the DOM?
The Document Object Model (DOM) is a crucial concept in web development. 
It connects web pages to scripts or programming languages by representing the structure of an HTML document (such as the HTML representing a web page) in memory. Essentially, the DOM allows you to interact with and manipulate the content of a web page dynamically. 
Common Methods and Properties of the Document Objects:
1.Finding HTML Elements
2.Changing HTML Elements
3.Adding and Deleting Elements
4.Event Handling

Window objects:
The window object represents an open window in a browser.When you run JavaScript within a browser, this object provides a top-level context for executing your code.
If a document contain frames (<iframe> tags), the browser creates one window object for the HTML document, and one additional window object for each frame.
window object is available globally, so you can directly use its properties and methods without explicitly referencing it.
By leveraging its properties and methods, developers can create dynamic and interactive web applications that respond to user actions, manipulate content, manage browser history, and much more.

Comparision between document and window objects
Document Objects:
    Represents a web page loaded in the browser.
    Accessed using window.document or simply document.
    Allows access to elements within the HTML page.
    Used for adding dynamic content to the web page.
    Common properties include:
        activeElement: Returns the currently active element.
        body: Returns the contents of the <body> element.
        title: Returns the title of the document.
    Common methods include:
        addEventListener(): Attaches an event handler.
        adoptNode(): Adopts a node from another document.

Window Objects:
    Represents the browser window or frame.
    Contains properties, methods, and functionalities related to the entire window.
    Global object accessible as window.
    The document object is a property of the window.
    Provides broader scope beyond the specific web page.
    Example properties:
        screen: Information about physical screen dimensions.
        location: URL of the current page.
In summary, while the document object focuses on representing and manipulating content within an HTML document, the window object encompasses the entire browser window and its properties.
